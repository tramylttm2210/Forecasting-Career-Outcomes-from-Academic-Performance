# Education & Career Success Analysis

## Purpose  
To analyze a synthetic dataset of 5,000 academic and career records to identify early academic performance indicators that predict future career success—providing actionable insights for educators and program designers to optimize student outcomes and support interventions.

## Tools & Packages  
- **Data cleaning**: `janitor`, `lubridate`, `dplyr`  
- **Visualization**: `ggplot2`  
- **Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, linear regression  

---

## Project Overview  
Cleaned and standardized a 5,000-record dataset using R. Transformed raw academic variables (e.g., first-semester grades) and filtered outliers to ensure a clean baseline for analysis. Converted dates, removed irrelevant columns, and eliminated incomplete entries.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Histograms** of academic performance to identify distribution trends  
- **Boxplots** showing clustering of grades across key subjects  
- **Correlation plots** revealing strong relationships between early grades and career metrics  

---

## Regression & Predictive Modeling  
- Built **simple linear regression models** to quantify how variations in first-semester academic performance forecast career outcomes  
- Used **scatter plots with trend lines** to visualize predictive strength  

---

## Key Insights  
- **Critical grade thresholds** identified: Students below certain GPA levels in early semesters may benefit from targeted support  
- **Career success is positively correlated** with performance in specific first-year courses  
- **Actionable takeaway**: Institutions should focus support initiatives early—especially in the foundational semester—to maximize long-term success

## Forecasting Student Outcomes  
While data was synthetic, regression analysis suggests that small improvements in early academic performance yield measurable gains in career metrics over time.   
Educational programs can enhance career readiness by identifying at-risk students early and applying focused academic support strategies.
